# The Ultimate Guide to Korean 10-Step Skincare Routine

Korean skincare has taken the world by storm, and for good reason. The famous 10-step routine isn't just about using more products—it's about layering lightweight, targeted treatments to achieve healthy, glowing skin.

## The 10 Steps Explained

### 1. Oil Cleanser
Start with an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and oil-based impurities.

### 2. Water-Based Cleanser
Follow with a gentle foam or gel cleanser to remove remaining dirt and sweat.

### 3. Exfoliant (2-3 times per week)
Use a chemical exfoliant like BHA or AHA to remove dead skin cells.

### 4. Toner
Apply a hydrating toner to balance your skin's pH and prepare it for treatments.

### 5. Essence
This lightweight, concentrated treatment helps with skin renewal and hydration.

### 6. Serums/Treatments
Target specific concerns like dark spots, fine lines, or acne.

### 7. Sheet Mask (1-2 times per week)
Intensive treatment for extra hydration and nourishment.

### 8. Eye Cream
Gentle care for the delicate eye area.

### 9. Moisturizer
Seal in all the previous layers with a suitable moisturizer.

### 10. Sunscreen (AM only)
Never skip SPF during the day—it's the most important anti-aging step.

## Tips for Success

- Start slowly and build up gradually
- Listen to your skin's needs
- Quality over quantity—you don't need all 10 steps every day
- Patch test new products
- Be consistent for best results
